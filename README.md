# 🚀 Ruby 2D Platformer Game (Metal Slug Inspired)  
*A simple 2D platformer game built with Ruby and Ruby2D to explore game development fundamentals.*  

---

## 🎮 Features  
- **Player Movement**: Left/right movement with directional sprites.  
- **Jumping Mechanics**: Gravity simulation and ground collision.  
- **Projectile System**: Shoot red bullets with the `Z` key.  
- **Basic Collisions**: Player-ground interaction.  
- **State Management**: Menu ↔ Gameplay transitions.
